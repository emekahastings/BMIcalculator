      <h1 id='header'> BMI CALCULATOR</h1>
    <div id='writeup'>       First question is what is BMI?, Dont look too far, it is Body Mass Index  and this refers to the ratio of  <br>
       of height to weight of an individual. It is usually an indicator of Malnutrition, normalcy or obesity. <br>
       It is very important that we know our BMI and as a basic as it sounds, most people dont know it so i decided <br>
       to build a calculator that could solve that problem <br>
       
       The range of Body Mass index and where they fall under are:
       <ul>
           <li> Below 18.5 is Malnourished</li>
           <li>18.5-24.9 is  Normal</li>
           <li>25.0- 29.9 is  Overweight</li>
           <li> Above 30 is  Obese</li>
       </ul>
        
       If i ask you now what your height in meter is, chance is you dont know and its not your fault, most people dont eiher <br>
       This is why we have a calculator that helps you convert your height from feet to meter </div>

    <div id='entire'>
       <div id="box">
        <h2 id="to-m"> CONVERT Height (Feet to Meter)</h2>
        <input type="number" class="length"  id="space" placeholder="height in ft" > <br> <br>

        <textarea name=""  id="display" cols="10" rows="5"></textarea> <br> <br>

        <button id="show"> CALCULATE</button>
         </div>
    
       <div id="hbox">
        <h3> Calculates your BMI with no stress</h3>
         
        <input type="number"  id="length" placeholder="Height in m" > <br> <br>

        <input type="number" id="weight" placeholder="Weight in kg"> <br> <br>
